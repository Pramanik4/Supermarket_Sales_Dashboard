# Define a problem statement
Many mini-supermarket owners manage sales data in numeric form, which can hinder their ability to gain a clear understanding of their sales performance. This Power BI Sales Dashboard helps bridge that gap by providing insightful visualizations of sales figures on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. By analyzing these trends, supermarket owners can make data-driven decisions to optimize sales performance and ultimately maximize profits.
